## Introduction

In this notebook, I will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. My completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the Persian translation.

The notebook consists of four parts:

   - Dataset: **To laod and investigate dataset.**
   - Preprocess: **To convert text to sequence of integers.**
   - Models: **To Create models which accepts a sequence of integers as input and returns a probability distribution over possible translations.**
   - Prediction: **To use the trained model to make prediction on test dataset.**
